# jQuery Format Phone

Formats text fields as phone numbers on the fly, like
when you type in the iPhone's phone number field.

## Usage

Just call `formatsPhone` where you want the behavior.

    $('input[type="text"]').formatsPhone();

With that code, all text inputs on that page will format phone numbers.

### TODO

* Backspace behavior is a bit weird.
